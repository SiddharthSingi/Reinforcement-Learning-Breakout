# Reinforcement-Learning
Using the OpenAI gym to train an RL agent to play MountainCar.

Deep Q Learning, Double Deep Q Learning, Experience Replay, and Prioritized Experience Replay.

In this project, I have python to build some of the most commonly used algorithms in reinforcement learning. The major frameworks I have used in this project are:
* Keras
* OpenAI gym
* Numpy
