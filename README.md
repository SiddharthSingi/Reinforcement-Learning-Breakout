In this project, I have python to build some of the most commonly used algorithms in reinforcement learning. The major frameworks I have used in this project are:
* Keras
* OpenAI gym
* Numpy

The techniques used in this project are:

* Deep Q Learning
* Double Deep Q Learning 
* Experience Replay
* Prioritized Experience Replay.
* Fixed Targets Networks
